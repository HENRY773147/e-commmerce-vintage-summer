            <h1>Refund policy</h1><br><br>
            <h3>Returns and Refunds</h3><br>
            <p><strong>Returning an unwanted item?</strong></p>
            <p>We get it, sometimes something just doesn&rsquo;t work for you and you want your money back. Don&rsquo;t worry, as long as an item is still in its original condition, we accept returns for free, subject to the rules below which includes rules around Fair Use.</p>
            <p>If you return an item requesting a refund within 4 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method.</p>
            <p>We aim to refund you within 14 days of receiving the returned item.</p>
            <p>If you request a refund for an item during the above time frames but you can't return it to us for some reason, please get in touch - but any refund will be at our discretion.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>After that?</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t accept returns for unwanted items after the relevant returns period above. If you try to make a return, we may have to send it back to you and ask you to cover the delivery costs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Keep it clean</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;Hygiene and your and all of our customers&rsquo; safety is super important, so certain items can&rsquo;t be returned for refunds including:</p>
            <p>&bull; Underwear if the hygiene seal is not intact or any labels have been broken</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Original condition</strong></p>
            <p>All returned items should be sent back to us in their original condition together with the original packaging and all Vintage summer and brand tags.</p>
            <p>Footwear &ndash; only try on footwear on carpeted floors to protect the soles. They must also be returned with the original box (if any) and original any shoe or dust bags (if any).</p>
            <p>All items are inspected on return. Of course, it&rsquo;s fine to try an item on like you would in a store, but don&rsquo;t actually wear or use it. When trying on clothing please be careful with the item (don&rsquo;t use unnecessary force) and don&rsquo;t wear make-up, perfume, cologne, deodorant or antiperspirant as these can mark and leave scents on the item.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;If an item is returned to us worn, used, damaged or in an unsaleable condition, or where the above instructions have not been followed, we won&rsquo;t be able to give you a refund and we may have to send it back to you (and ask you to cover the delivery costs). Alternatively, we (at our sole discretion) may choose to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of an item.</p>
            <p>None of this affects your statutory rights.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Fair use</strong></p>
            <p>If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn&rsquo;t sit right: e.g. we suspect someone is actually wearing their purchases and then returning them, ordering and returning loads &ndash; way, waaay more than even the most loyal Comfy Monkey customer would order or the items returned don&rsquo;t match what you ordered &ndash; then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated accounts. If this happens to you and you think we&rsquo;ve made a mistake, please get in touch with Customer Care and we&rsquo;ll be happy to discuss it with you.</p>
            <p>If your account has been deactivated and you need to make a valid return, contact Customer Care. They&rsquo;ll give you a returns label although you will be responsible for the cost of returning the goods to us.</p>
            <p>Please note, we reserve the right to take legal action against you if the items you return don&rsquo;t match what you ordered.</p>
            <p><strong>This doesn&rsquo;t affect your statutory rights.</strong></p>
